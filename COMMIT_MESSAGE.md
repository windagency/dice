fix: New shell-agnostic architecture implementation

**Core Change**: Converted DICE development environment from shell-specific to universal POSIX-compliant architecture

### **ðŸ”§ Key Improvements**

**Shell Compatibility**
- âœ… POSIX-compliant scripts (works with zsh, bash, dash, any POSIX shell)
- âœ… Removed shell-specific features (associative arrays, BASH_SOURCE)
- âœ… Universal path resolution and script loading

**Architecture Enhancements**
- âœ… Unified service management with string-based configurations
- âœ… Helper functions for data lookup (`get_service_config`, `get_profile_config`)
- âœ… Clean Makefile without explicit shell specifications

**New Features**
- âœ… Profile support for orchestrator service (`--proxy`)
- âœ… Comprehensive development workflows (`quick-start`, `dev-*`, `test-*`)
- âœ… Enhanced health monitoring and backup/restore capabilities

### **ï¿½ï¿½ Code Cleanup**
- âœ… Removed legacy ELK stack management targets
- âœ… Consolidated logging and health check functionality
- âœ… Eliminated redundant targets and improved organization

### **âœ… Validation**
- âœ… Tested with zsh, bash, dash
- âœ… Verified `make quick-start` works across all shells
- âœ… All service management commands operational

### **ðŸ“ˆ Benefits**
- **Universal**: Works on macOS, Linux, BSD with any POSIX shell
- **Maintainable**: Follows shell scripting best practices
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes, existing commands work

**Result**: Shell-agnostic DICE development environment with enhanced workflows and universal compatibility ðŸš€
