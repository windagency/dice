# AI Editor Handoff Summary - DICE Infrastructure Implementation

**Date**: 2024-12-26  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Primary Document**: `01-LOCAL-INFRA-PLAN.md`

## üéØ Implementation Overview

You are tasked with implementing a **containerised development environment** for the DICE D&D character manager monorepo following a **phased approach**. All critical issues have been resolved and the plan is technically sound.

## üìã Key Architecture Decisions (Final)

### Technology Stack

- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for simplicity and rapid iteration
- **Production**: Kubernetes migration path with Rancher Desktop
- **API Strategy**:
  - **tRPC**: Web frontend communication
  - **GraphQL Federation**: Flutter mobile app communication
- **SSL**: Traefik built-in certificate generation (no mkcert complexity)

### Service Dependencies (Corrected)

```plaintext
PostgreSQL ‚Üí Backend Service
PostgreSQL ‚Üí PayloadCMS
Redis ‚Üí Backend Service  
Backend ‚Üê PWA (optional dependency)
Monitoring ‚Üí All Services (optional)
```

## üîß Critical Specifications

### Resource Requirements (Realistic)

- **Phase 1**: 6-8GB RAM, 3GB disk space
- **Phase 2**: 8-10GB RAM, 5GB disk space  
- **Phase 3**: 10-12GB RAM, 8GB disk space

### Performance Expectations (Realistic)

- **Backend Hot Reload**: < 8 seconds
- **PWA Hot Reload**: < 5 seconds
- **Service Startup**: < 2 minutes full stack

### Version Specifications (Latest Stable)

- **Node.js**: 22-bullseye
- **PostgreSQL**: 17-bullseye  
- **Redis**: 7-bullseye
- **LocalStack**: 4.0
- **kubectl**: v1.33
- **Traefik**: v3.0

## üìä Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Development (2-3 weeks)

**Goal**: Basic development workflow functioning

**Key Components**:

- Root DevContainer with Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL + Redis data layer
- Nest.js backend with debugging
- Astro.js PWA with hot reload
- Traefik SSL termination

**Success Criteria**:

- Services start in dependency order
- HTTPS endpoints accessible (api.dice.local, pwa.dice.local)
- Hot reload functioning within performance targets
- Database seeded with development data

### Phase 2: Enhanced Development (1-2 weeks)  

**Goal**: Production-ready development workflow

**Key Components**:

- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- PayloadCMS with D&D rules data
- Comprehensive Makefile commands
- Pre-commit hooks and code quality
- Independent service modes

### Phase 3: Production Features (1-2 weeks)

**Goal**: Production deployment capability

**Key Components**:

- HashiCorp Vault secrets management
- ELK stack centralised logging
- Jaeger distributed tracing
- Redis clustering
- Kubernetes deployment manifests

## üÜò Critical Support Sections Added

### Database Migration Strategy

- Automatic TypeORM migrations
- Development data reseeding
- Schema rollback procedures

### Authentication Strategy  

- Simple shared secrets for development
- JWT tokens for web/mobile clients
- API key validation between services

### Data Persistence Strategy

- Docker volume structure defined
- Automated backup procedures
- Manual backup/restore commands

### Troubleshooting Guide

- Common development issues
- Service debugging commands
- SSL certificate troubleshooting

### Comprehensive Rollback Procedures

- Phase-specific rollback commands
- Emergency reset procedures
- Backup point creation/restoration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Warnings

### Avoid These Pitfalls

1. **Don't** use mkcert - stick to Traefik built-in SSL
2. **Don't** implement rigid service dependencies - allow optional PWA connection
3. **Don't** underestimate resource requirements - plan for 8GB+ RAM
4. **Don't** expect < 3 second hot reload - be realistic with 5-8 seconds
5. **Don't** skip rollback procedures - implement them with each phase

### Success Validation Gates

Each phase has specific validation checkpoints that MUST pass before proceeding to the next phase.

## üìÅ Files to Create

### Core Infrastructure

- `docker-compose.yml` (primary orchestration)
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (VS Code support)
- `Makefile` (service management commands)
- `scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh` (automated setup)

### Configuration

- `.env.development` (development secrets)
- `traefik.yml` (SSL and routing configuration)  
- `prometheus.yml` (monitoring configuration)

### Documentation

- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (progress tracking)
- `README.md` (developer onboarding)
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (common issues)

## üéØ Success Definition

**Phase 1 Complete When**:

- Developer can run `make start-all` and access all services via HTTPS
- Hot reload works within performance targets
- All validation checkpoints pass

**Phase 2 Complete When**:

- Monitoring dashboards show service health
- PayloadCMS populated with D&D data
- Independent service modes functional

**Phase 3 Complete When**:

- Production Kubernetes manifests working
- Security scanning passes
- Load testing completes successfully

## üìû Escalation Path

**User (Developer)**: Validates architectural decisions and technical choices  
**Current Status**: Infrastructure plan finalised and ready for implementation

---

**Implementation Note**: This plan has undergone comprehensive critical review and all major technical issues have been resolved. Follow the phased approach strictly and implement validation gates to ensure quality at each step.

**Good luck with the implementation!** üöÄ
