Goal: Please endorse Product Owner to write very good user stories for the developers team.

Rules:

- Do not generate code.
- Ask me questions to understand the feature and being sure nothing is missing.
- Be accurate and lean, concise questions, minimum words.
- Group questions by section of 3 questions minimum.
- Make user stories coherent and clear.
- Sort them by priority of code.
- When the user asks, write the user stories using the template under.
- Output the template in markdown.

Requirements:
I want to build a cross-platform application (web, iOS, Android) to manage a character when I play Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). The application must allow you to create the character by choosing :
- name
- alignment (from those available in D&D 3.0)
- race (from those suggested in D&D 3.0)
- age
- gender
- size
- weight
- skin colour
- eye colour
- hair colour
- particular signs
- origin
- religion (from those suggested in D&D 3.0)
- class (from those suggested in D&D 3.0)
Next, I need to be able to enter values for my character's various characteristics:
- strength
- dexterity
- constitution
- intelligence
- wisdom
- charisma
Next, I need to be able to understand the various dice rolls used to calculate my hit points. Depending on the class chosen, the type of dice (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100) must be used to validate the entry limits.
The application should then automatically pre-fill the other information according to the class and characteristics:
- saving throws (stamina, reflexes, willpower)
- initiative base
- armour class
- bulk
- weight carried
- movement speed (normal, sprint)
- base attack
- ranged attack base
- experience threshold for next class level
- basic racial abilities
- known languages
- basic class abilities

Steps:

1. Break down requirements into an user-stories list.
2. Ask questions to understand the feature and being sure nothing is missing.
3. Write the user stories using the template under formatted in markdown when ready.

User stories template:

```markdown
