## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions Made

- **Technology Stack**: Docker Compose for local development, Kubernetes for production deployment
- **API Strategy**: GraphQL Federation (Flutter mobile app) + tRPC (web frontend)
- **SSL Strategy**: Traefik built-in certificate generation for development
- **Environment Strategy**: Development (.env files) vs Production (Vault, clustering)
- **Implementation Approach**: Phased (minimal ‚Üí enhanced ‚Üí production-ready)
- **Resource Planning**: Realistic 6-8GB RAM minimum for development

### Key Success Criteria

- Each service must be startable independently
- Hot reload < 8 seconds for backend, < 5 seconds for frontend
- All services accessible via HTTPS with valid certificates
- Clear phase-based validation gates with measurable outcomes

### Contact & Escalation

- **Developer (User)**: Validates architectural decisions and technical choices
- **AI Editor**: Implements the structured plan with proper validation gates
- **Current Status**: Ready to hand-off to AI Editor for implementation
